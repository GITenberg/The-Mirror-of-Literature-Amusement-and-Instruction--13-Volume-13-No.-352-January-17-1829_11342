<h3>PRINCE RUPERT'S PALACE</h3>
<div class="figure" style="width:60%;"><a href=
"images/352-1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/352-1.png" alt=
"Prince Rupert's Palace, Barbican" /></a></div>
<p>Prince Rupert, who will be remembered in the annals of the
useful and fine arts when his military fame shall be forgotten,
resided at a house in Beech-lane, Barbican, of the remains of which
the above is a representation. His residence here was in the time
of Charles II.; for it is said that Charles paid him a visit, when
the ringers of Cripplegate had a guinea for complimenting the royal
guest with a "merry peal." As the abode of a man of science, (for
the prince was one of the most ingenious men of his time,) this
engraving will doubtless be acceptable to the readers of the
MIRROR. It, moreover, shows that even at that period, a residence
in the City and its neighbourhood was not thought derogatory to a
man of rank or fortune.<a id="footnotetag1" name=
"footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>With the historical character of Prince Rupert, most of our
readers are probably familiar. Many useful inventions resulted from
his studies, among which are the invention of "Prince's Metal,"
locks for fire-arms, improvements in gunpowder, &amp;c. After the
restoration, he was admitted into the Privy Council. He likewise
became a fellow of the newly-founded Royal Society, and a member of
the Board of Trade; and to his influence is ascribed the
establishment of the Hudson's Bay Company, of which he was the
first governor. Orford, Evelyn, and Vertue attribute to him the
invention of mezzotinto engraving; but this has been disputed, and,
we believe, disproved.</p>

<h2>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE COLOSSEUM, IN THE REGENT'S PARK.</h2>
<p>By the courtesy of Mr. Hornor, the proprietor, we have been
favoured with a private view of the <i>interior</i> of this
stupendous building; and, as it is our intention to illustrate the
ensuing Number of the MIRROR with a view of the exterior, we shall
for the present confine ourselves to such descriptive details as we
have been enabled to collect in our recent visit. The interior is,
however, in an unfinished state; the works are in actual progress,
and the operations of the several artists continue uninterrupted by
the access of visiters.</p>
<p>On entering the edifice by the large door in front, a staircase
on the right leads to a passage, which communicates with a circular
saloon hung with coloured drapery. This room, which, when finished,
will be the largest of the kind in London, occupies the whole
internal space, or the basement of the building, with the exception
of the staircase leading to the summit, which rises like a large
column from the centre. This circular saloon is intended for the
exhibition of paintings and other productions of the fine arts; and
it redounds highly to the credit of Mr. Hornor, that this
exhibition is to be entirely free of charge to the artists. Such an
introduction of their works to public notice cannot fail to prove
mutually advantageous.</p>
<p>It may be here necessary to state that the wall of the building
represents a panoramic <i>View of London</i>, as seen from the
several galleries of St. Paul's Cathedral&mdash;and that the view
of the picture is obtained from three galleries&mdash;the
<i>first</i> of which corresponds, in relation to the view, with
the first gallery at the summit of the dome of St. Paul's; the
<i>second</i> is like that of the upper gallery on the same
edifice; and the <i>third</i>, from its great elevation, commands a
view of the remote distance which describes the horizon in the
painting. Above the last-mentioned gallery is placed the identical
copper ball which for so many years occupied the summit of St.
Paul's; and above it is a fac-simile of the cross by which it was
surmounted. Over these is hung the small wooden cabin in which Mr.
Hornor made his drawings for the picture, in the same perilous
situation it occupied during the period of the repairs which some
years ago were done to the cathedral. A small flight of stairs
leads from this spot to the open gallery which surrounds the top of
the Colosseum, commanding a view of the Regent's Park and the
subjacent country.</p>
<p>The communication with the galleries is by staircases of curious
construction, built on the outer side of the central column already
mentioned. This column is hollow, and within it a small circular
chamber is to be caused to ascend when freighted with company, by
means of machinery, with an imperceptible motion to the first
gallery. The doors of the chamber will then open, and by this novel
means of being elevated, visiters may avoid the fatigue of
ascending by the stairs, and then walk out into the gallery to
enjoy the picture.</p>
<p>In extent and accuracy, the Panorama is one of the most
surprising achievements of art in this or any other country. The
picture covers upwards of 40,000 square feet, or nearly an acre of
canvass; the dome of the building on which the sky is painted, is
thirty feet more in diameter than the cupola of St. Paul's; and the
circumference of the horizon from the point of view, is nearly 130
miles. The painting is almost completed; indeed, sufficiently so,
for the general effect; although this will be considerably
increased by the insertion of the remaining details, and the last
or finishing touches. Much as the spectator will be struck by the
fidelity of the representation, there is one claim it has to his
admiration, which has only to be explained to be universally
acknowledged. It is simply this. Only let such of our readers as
have ascended the galleries of St. Paul's, think of the fatigue
they experienced in the toil, and comparatively speaking, the
little gratification they experienced on their arrival at the
summit. In short, what had they for their pains but the distinct
roofs of the houses in the immediate vicinity, while the rest of
the city was half lost in fog and the smoke of "groves of
chimneys." The only period at which London <i>can be seen</i>, is
at sun-rise on a fine summer morning&mdash;such a morning, for
instance, as that of the last Coronation. This too must be before
the many thousand fires are lighted&mdash;exactly the period at
which it is impossible to gain admittance to the cathedral. In the
Panorama of the Colosseum, therefore, alone it is that we can see
the "mighty heart," the town we inhabit; and for this grand scene
we are indebted to the indefatigable genius of Mr. Hornor.<a id=
"footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href=
"#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name="page35"></a>[pg
35]</span>
<p>The magnificent effect of the Panorama, however, baffles all
description of our pen. Indeed, the scene gives rise to so many
inspiring associations in an enthusiastic mind, that few
Englishmen, and still fewer Londoners, are equal to the detail of
its description. Every inch of the vast circumference abounds with
subject for reflection. The streets filled with passengers and
vehicles&mdash;the grandeur of the public buildings, churches, and
palatial structures&mdash;the majestic river winding grandly along,
with the shipping, vessels, and gay trim of civic barges gliding on
its surface, its banks studded with splendid hospitals, docks, and
antique towers&mdash;and its stream crossed with magnificent
bridges&mdash;till it stretches away beyond the busy haunts of
industry, to the rural beauties of Richmond, and the castellated
splendour of Windsor. Of course, the river is the most attractive
object in the painting; but overlooking the merits of the town
itself, and the world of streets and buildings&mdash;the
representation of the environs is delightfully picturesque, and the
distances are admirably executed; while the whole forms an
assemblage of grandeur, unparalleled in art, as the reality is in
the history of mankind.</p>
<p>The grand and distinguishing merit of the Panorama at the
Colosseum is, however, of a higher order than we have yet pointed
out to the reader. It has the <i>unusual</i> interest of
picturesque effect with the most scrupulous accuracy; and, in
illustration of the latter excellence, so plain are the principal
streets in the view, that thousands of visitors will be able to
identify their own dwellings. We have termed this an unusual
effect, because we are accustomed to view panoramas as fine
productions of art, with fascinating and novel contrasts, and
altogether as beautiful pictures; but pleasing as may be their
effect on the spectator, it must fall very short of the intense
interest created by the topographical or map-like accuracy of Mr.
Hornor's picture, which is correct even to the most minute point of
detail. Thousands of spectators will therefore become rivetted by
some particular objects, for every Londoner can name a score of
sites which are endeared to him by some grateful recollections and
associations of his life; whilst our country friends will be lost
in admiration at the immense knot of dwellings, till they contrive
to pick their road back to their inn or temporary abode in this
queen of cities. In order to court the rigorous inspection of the
most critical visiters, engraved sections of the various parts of
the picture, numbered and described, will be placed in the
compartments to which the panorama corresponds; and for still
further gratification, glasses will he placed in the gallery, by
which houses at the distance of ten or twelve miles from the city
may easily be discerned. All this amounts to microscopic painting,
or the most elaborate mosaic-work of art.</p>
<p>The effect of the near houses, or those in the immediate
vicinity of St. Paul's, is very striking; and the perspective and
effect of light and shade of the campanile towers in front of the
cathedral are admirably managed. In short, nothing can exceed the
fine contrast of the bold and broad buildings in the fore-ground
with the work of the middle, and the minuteness of the
back-ground:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Now to the sister hills that skirt her plain,</p>
<p>To lofty Harrow now, and now to where</p>
<p>Majestic Windsor lifts his princely brow,</p>
<p>In lovely contrast to this glorious view,</p>
<p>Calmly magnificent.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Heavens! what a goodly prospect spreads around,</p>
<p>Of hills, and dales, and woods, and lawns, and spires,</p>
<p>
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-till
all</p>
<p>The stretching landscape into mist decays.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It seems scarcely possible for painting to achieve anything
nearer to reality than has been effected in the union of the
projecting portions and the flat surface of the picture&mdash;an
effect which will be hailed with enthusiasm by the spectator. This
part is the work of Mr. Paris, "of whose talents and valuable
assistance in the execution of the painting," says a writer in the
<i>Times</i>, "the proprietor speaks in terms of generous
enthusiasm, which are well deserved, and equally honourable to both
parties." Another critical writer, in the <i>Weekly Review</i>,
likewise, pays a deserved tribute to the genius of Mr. Paris, in
his share of the painting. He says, "The spectator who shall view
this magnificent Panorama, without being previously informed of the
difficulties with which the able and indefatigable artist, Mr. E.T.
Paris, had to contend, however he may be struck with the <i>tout
ensemble</i>, will hardly be able to appreciate the merit of the
work. In the first place, as no one individual could accomplish
such an undertaking in a sufficiently short period, many artists
were necessarily employed; each of these had his own peculiar
style, and taste, and notions, which of course he would not depart
from; when each of the assistant artists, therefore, had finished
his part, it was necessary for Mr. Paris to go himself over the
whole, retouch everything, and reduce the various parts into
harmony with each other. This he has effected in the most admirable
manner, so <span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name=
"page36"></a>[pg 36]</span> that, at present the productions of
numerous dissimilar pencils appear like the creation of one man.
Another, and perhaps still greater difficulty, was to preserve the
true perspective from so elevated and novel a point of view, and on
curved canvass; for, by the closing of the dome, that part of the
picture upon which the greatest distance was to be represented, is
in reality placed nearest to the spectator. We must observe,
however, that these difficulties have all been surmounted, and that
the illusion is most complete."</p>
<p>Our limits advise us to quit the principal building, or that
appropriated to the panoramic view, especially as we cannot convey
to the reader an indistinct notion of the curious stair-work,
machinery, and carpentry of the ascents, &amp;c. We were induced to
ascend to the exterior, but the mid-day smoke of the town, and the
heavy fog of the day, spoiled our view. Had it not been so, the
numerous buildings below, with the gardens, &amp;c. would have
reminded us that much yet remained to be seen. We hastened down the
staircase, as quickly as the loop-hole light would allow, (for this
part is to be lit with gas,) and returned to the front court by the
large door at which we entered. In the entrance-hall are two aloes
in tubs, one of them of noble size, and we could not help
contrasting this single triumph of Nature with the little world of
art we had just been exploring; and our train of reflection was
unbroken on our entering by the left-hand lodge-door, a range of
arched conservatories, in the centre of one of which is a
<i>Camellia Japonica</i>, which produces thirty varieties of
flower, and is, perhaps, the most magnificent specimen in England.
Already here are several rare and beautiful plants&mdash;a large
proportion of exotics, and some of the most curious plants of this
country's growth. In the centre of one of the chambers is a
circular tank of water, surrounded by small <i>jets</i>, which are
to raise their streams so as to form a round case of water, within
which are to be aquatic plants, &amp;c. At the end of this room
aviaries are in preparation.</p>
<p>Hence we ascended into a beautiful reading-room, with French
windows and rusticated Gothic verandas. The <i>artistes</i> were
here busy in hanging the walls, &amp;c. with green damask moreen.
The next room in the suite will be a library of beautiful
proportions; and beyond this will be another room equally splendid,
besides numerous other smaller apartments, in all numbering thirty.
The object of this part of the building is to afford to subscribers
all the advantages of a club and a reading-room, combined with the
novel and luxurious conveniences of the establishment. We now come
to what appears to us the <i>bijou</i> of the whole. A passage
leads from the saloon to a suite of small chambers, representing a
Swiss cottage. One of these rooms is finished. It is wainscotted
with coloured (knotted) wood, and carved in imitation of the
fanciful interior of the dwellings of the Swiss mountaineers. The
immense projecting chimney, its capacious corners, and the
stupendous fire-dogs, are truly characteristic charms of cottage
life; and the illusion is not a little enhanced by the prospect
from the windows, consisting of terrific rocks and caverns,<a id=
"footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href=
"#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> among which a cascade is to fall from
an immense height into a lake, which is to spread immediately
beneath the windows. The water is not yet admitted here; but from
some successful specimens of this branch of art, which we have
seen, we are induced to think the Swiss cottage and its scenery
will be very attractive. The exterior of the dwelling, with its
broad eaves, &amp;c. is beautifully picturesque; and the interior,
supplied with a <i>suite</i> of rustic furniture, is even
sufficiently unique for the <i>recherch&eacute;</i> taste of Mr.
Hope.</p>
<p>This is but an imperfect outline of the ingenious works which
are now just finishing at the Colosseum. The undertaking, as the
name imports, is one of the most gigantic enterprises for public
gratification which it has ever been our lot to witness; but great
as may be the capital already expended here, and indefatigable as
have been the exertions of the proprietor during the last seven
years, it is almost impossible that such genius should not be amply
remunerated. As a concentration of every refined amusement and
luxurious comfort which the taste of the times can dictate, the
Colosseum will doubtless be without a rival in Europe. The charms
of useful and elegant literature will here alternate with the
exquisite masterpieces of modern art&mdash;and to aid these
attractions, the pure pleasures of the garden and green-house, and
studies from the wild and wonderful of sublime nature&mdash;will be
superadded. The extent occupied by the requisite buildings, &amp;c.
is, as we were informed, little short of five acres.</p>
<p>To conclude, the Colosseum will very shortly be opened to the
public. In the meantime, such persons as wish, may be gratified
with a private view of the works in their present state, on terms
which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page37" name="page37"></a>[pg
37]</span> have already been announced by the proprietor.</p>

<h3>HIEROGLYPHICAL CHARACTERS.</h3>
<h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
<p>Hieroglyphics consist in certain symbols which are made to stand
for invisible objects, on account of some analogy which such
symbols were supposed to bear to the objects. Egypt was the country
where this sort of writing was most studied, and brought into a
regular science. In hieroglyphics was conveyed all the boasted
knowledge of their priests. According to the properties which they
ascribed to animals, they chose them to be the emblems of moral
objects. Thus ingratitude was expressed by a viper; imprudence, by
a fly; wisdom, by an ant; knowledge, by an eye; eternity, by a
circle which has neither beginning nor end; a man universally
shunned, by an eel, which they supposed to be found with no other
fish. Sometimes they joined two or more of these characters
together, as a serpent with a hawk's head, denoted nature, with God
presiding over it.</p>

<h2>MANNERS &amp; CUSTOMS OF ALL NATIONS.</h2>
<h3>BULL-FIGHTS AT LIMA.</h3>
<h4><i>From General Miller's Memoirs. Second edition.</i></h4>
<p>The taste for bull-fights, introduced by the early Spaniards, is
retained by their American descendants with undiminished ardour.
The announcement of an exhibition of this kind produces a state of
universal excitement. The streets are thronged, and the population
of the surrounding country, dressed in their gayest attire, add to
the multitudes of the city. The sport is conducted with an
&eacute;clat that exceeds the bull-fights in every other part of
South America, and perhaps even surpasses those of Madrid. The
death of the bull, when properly managed, creates as much interest
in the ladies of Lima, as the death of the hare to the English
huntress, or the winning horse to the titled dames at Newmarket or
Doncaster. Nor can the pugilistic <i>fancy</i> of England take a
deeper interest in the event of a prize-fight, than the gentlemen
of Lima in the scientific worrying of a bull. It is curious to
observe how various are ideas of cruelty in different countries.
The English, for instance, exclaim against the barbarity of the
bull-fight, as compared with the noble sport of cock-fighting,
badger-baiting, &amp;c. But their enlightened horror could not
exceed the disgust shown by a young South American, who witnessed a
casual boxing-match between two boys in Hyde Park, surrounded and
encouraged, as he expressed himself, by well-dressed barbarians. It
is amusing to witness the complacency with which one nation accuses
another of cruelty, without taking a glance at customs at home. The
bulls destined for the ring are obtained principally from the woods
in the valleys of Chincha, where they are bred in a wild state. To
catch and drive them to Lima, a distance of sixty leagues, is a
matter of no inconsiderable expense. A bull is given by each
<i>gremio</i>, or incorporated trading company of the city. The
gremios vie in decorating their donation, which is bedizened with
ribbons and flowers; across its shoulders are suspended mantles
richly embroidered with the arms of the gremio to which it belongs,
all of which become the perquisite of the <i>Toreador</i> or
<i>Matador</i> who slays the bull. The price of admission is four
reals, or two shillings; but an additional charge is made for seats
in the boxes; and the managers pay a considerable tax to government
on every performance. Early in the afternoon of the day fixed upon
for a bull-fight, every street leading to the amphitheatre is
crowded with carriages, horsemen, and pedestrians. All are in the
highest state of excitement, the highest glee, and in full dress.
The business of the ring commences, about 2 p.m. by a curious sort
of prelude. A company of soldiers perform a <i>despejo</i>, or a
military pantomime. The men having <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page38" name="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span> been previously drilled
for that purpose, go through a variety of fanciful evolutions,
forming the Roman and Greek crosses, stars, and figures, so
describing a sentence, such as <i>viva la patria, viva San
Martin</i>, or the name of any other person who happens to be at
the head of the government. As a <i>finale</i>, the soldiers form a
circle, face outwards, then advance towards the boxes, preserving
their circular order, which they extend, until they approach close
enough to climb up to the benches. Every movement is made to the
sound of the drum; the effect is exceedingly good. A band of music
is likewise in attendance, and plays at intervals. The prelude
being over, six or seven toreador enter the arena on foot, dressed
in silk jackets of different colours, richly spangled or bordered
with gold or silver lace. One or two of these men, and who are
called <i>matadores</i>, are pardoned criminals, and they receive a
considerable sum for every bull they kill. About the same time
various amateurs, well mounted on steeds gaily caparisoned,
fancifully and tastefully attired, present themselves. When all is
prepared, a door is opened under the box occupied by the
municipality, and a bull rushes from a pen. At first he gazes about
as if in surprise, but is soon put upon his mettle, by the waving
of flags and the throwing of darts, crackers, and other annoyances.
The amateur cavaliers display their horsemanship and skill in
provoking and in eluding his vengeance, in order to catch the eye
of some favourite fair one, and to gain the applause of their
friends and the audience. They infuriate the animal by waving a
mantle over his head, and when pursued they do not allow their
horses to advance more than a few inches from the horns of the
angry bull. When at full speed, they make their horse revolve upon
his hind legs, and remain in readiness to make a second turn upon
the animal. This operation is several times repeated with equal
agility and boldness, and is called <i>capear</i>. The amateurs
then promenade around to acknowledge the plaudits bestowed. This
species of sparring on horseback with the bull, is practised only
in South America. Indeed in no other part of the world is the
training of the horses, or the dexterity of the horseman, equal to
the performance of such exploits. Effigies made of skin and filled
with wind, and others made of straw, in which are live birds, are
placed in the arena. The bull tosses them in the air, but being
made heavy at the base, they come to the ground always retaining an
upright posture. The straw figures are furnished with fire-works,
which are made to take fire when the birds escape from within, and
it sometimes happens that the bull has the flaming and cracking
figure upon his horns. Sometimes the bull is maddened by fire-works
being fastened on him, which go off in succession. The crackers
being expended, the animal usually stands gazing around with
rolling tongue, panting sides, and eyes sparkling with rage. He is
then faced by the principal matador, who holds a straight sword in
one hand and a flag in the other; as the bull runs at him with full
speed, the matador coolly, but with great celerity, takes one step
to the left, holding the flag just over the spot he occupied when
the bull took aim. Being foiled, the bull wheels round, and charges
his tormentor a second time, who again skilfully eludes being
caught on the horns: this is repeated about three times, to the
great delight of the audience. At length the matador assumes a sort
of fencing attitude, and at the critical moment, plunges his sword
into the bull's neck, near to its shoulders, when it falls dead at
his feet. Handkerchiefs are waved, and applauding shouts resound
from every side. Four horses richly harnessed then appear. The dead
bull is quickly fixed to traces, and dragged out at a gallop,
cheered by continued acclamations.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Four steeds that spurn the rein, as swift as shy,</p>
<p>Hurl the dark bulk along, scarce seen in dashing by."</p>
<p><span style="margin-left:3em">BYRON.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Other bulls are killed in the same way by successive matadores.
One is generally despatched by means of a long knife grasped by the
matador, so that when his arm is extended, the blade is
perpendicular to the wrist. The bull being worried for a time, the
matador, instead of receiving him on the point of a sword as
before, steps one pace aside as the bull runs at him, and adroitly
plunges the knife into the spinal marrow behind the horns, and the
animal drops dead instantaneously. Another bull is next attacked by
mounted picadores, armed with lances. Their legs are protected by
padding. Their horses are of little value, and cannot easily get
out of the way of the bull. Neither do the riders often attempt it;
to do so being considered cowardly. The consequence is, the horses
generally receive a mortal gore; part of their entrails are
frequently torn out, and exhibit a most disgusting spectacle. The
riders run considerable risk, for their lances are inadequate to
killing the bull, which after being gored and mangled, is finally
despatched by a matador.</p>
<p>The next bull, as he sallies from the <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page39" name="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span> pen, is
encountered by six or eight Indians with short lances, who kneel
down like the front rank of a battalion to receive a cavalry
charge. One or two Indians are usually tossed; the others follow up
the bull, and when he turns upon them, they drop on one knee and
receive him as before. They are seldom able to despatch him, and a
matador steps forward to end his sufferings. Some of the Indians
are often much hurt: they invariably make themselves half drunk
before they enter the circus, alleging that they can fight the bull
better when they see double. Again, another bull is let into the
ring for the lanzada, or trial of the lance, the handle of which is
very long and strong, fixed into a wooden socket secured to the
ground, and supported by an Indian torrero. The head of the lance
is a long blade of highly tempered steel; and made sharp as a
razor. Before the bull is permitted to leave the pen, he is
rendered furious by a variety of torments. When he has been
sufficiently maddened, the doors are thrown open, and the animal
makes a rush at the Indian, who is dressed in scarlet, and directs
the lance as he kneels on the ground. The raging bull runs at him;
but he steadily points the lance, so as to receive the bull on its
point. Such is the force with which he plunges at his opponent,
that the lance generally enters at the head, and breaking through
skull and bones, comes out at the sides or back. Finally, a bull
with tail erect, comes bellowing and bounding in, with a man
strapped on his back. The animal jumps and capers about, making
every effort to rid himself of his burthen, to the no small
amusement of the spectators. The rider at length loosens the
straps, and the bull is attacked on all sides by amateurs and
matadores on foot and on horseback. When a matador has killed a
bull, he bows to the government box, then to the municipality, and
then all around, receiving plaudits in proportion to the skill he
has shown, and the sport he has afforded. Advancing then to the box
of the municipality, he receives his reward from one of the
members, who is appointed as judge on the occasion, which consists
of a few dollars thrown into the arena. When the spectators are
particularly gratified by the performance, they also throw money
into the ring.</p>

<h2>THE ANECDOTE GALLERY.</h2>
<h3>ANECDOTES OF CELEBRATED AUTHORS, FRENCH AND ITALIAN.</h3>
<p>Crebillon's manner of life was extremely singular. He slept
little, and lay very hard; he was always surrounded with about
thirty cats and dogs; and used to smoke tobacco, to keep his room
sweet against their exhalations. Being one day asked, in a large
company, which of his works he thought the best? "I don't know,"
answered he, "which is my best production; but this (pointing to
his son, who was present) is certainly my worst." "It is," replied
the son, with vivacity, "because no Carthusian had a hand in it,"
alluding to the report that the best passages in his father's
tragedies had been written by a Carthusian friar, who was his
friend.</p>
<p>Molieres, the celebrated French priest and mathematician, was a
very irritable man, which led him frequently into passions, of
which one was the cause of his death in 1742. In other respects he
was reckoned a very amiable character; but was apt to be so absent,
or absorbed in his studies, as to appear almost wholly insensible
to surrounding objects. His infirmity in this respect became known,
and he was accordingly made the subject of depredations. A
shoe-black once finding him profoundly absorbed in a reverie,
contrived to steal the silver buckles from his shoes, replacing
them with iron ones. At another time, while at his studies, a
villain broke into the room in which he was sitting, and demanded
his money; Molieres, without rising from his studies, or giving any
alarm, coolly showed him where it was, requesting him, as a great
favour, that he would not derange his papers.</p>
<p>Ariosto, the celebrated Italian poet, being asked why he had not
built his house in a more magnificent manner, and more suitable to
the noble descriptions which he had given of sumptuous palaces,
beautiful porticoes, and pleasant fountains, in his <i>Orlando
Furioso</i>, he replied, "that words were combined together with
less expense than stones." To such a degree was he charmed with his
own verse, and so much did he also excel in his manner of reading,
that he was always disgusted if he heard his own writings repeated
with an ill grace and accent. Accordingly, it is said, that, when
he accidentally heard a potter singing a stanza of his
<i>Orlando</i> in an incorrect and ungraceful manner, he was so
incensed, that he rushed into his shop and broke several of the
pots which were exposed to sale; when the potter expostulated with
him for this unprovoked injury, Ariosto replied, "I indeed have
broken half a dozen of your pots, which are not worth so many
halfpence, and you have spoiled a stanza of mine, which is worth a
considerable sum of gold." He <span class="pagenum"><a id="page40"
name="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span> was so attached to a plain and
frugal mode of life, that he says of himself in one of his poems,
"that he was a fit person to have lived in the world when acorns
were the food of mankind." His constitution was delicate and
infirm; and, notwithstanding his temperance and general
abstemiousness, his health was often interrupted. He bore his last
sickness with uncommon resolution and serenity; affirming, "that he
was willing to die on many accounts, and particularly because he
found that the greatest divines were of opinion that we shall know
one another in the other world;" and he observed to those who were
with him, "that many of his friends were departed, whom he desired
to visit, and that he thought every moment tedious till he gained
that happiness."</p>
<p>Dante, the celebrated Italian poet, has been described by
Boccacio, as of a middle stature, of a pensive and melancholy
expression in his countenance. He was courteous and civil, and his
way of living extremely temperate. He is said to have been a very
absent man, of which instances have been recorded; once meeting
with a book in an apothecary's, which he had been long looking for,
he opened it, and read from morning till night without being roused
from his pursuit by the distraction and tumult occasioned by a
great wedding passing through the street. For some time he roved
about Italy in an indigent and distressed condition, till he was
hospitably received by the Lord of Ravenna, his patron and
friend.</p>
<p>Paul Scarron, whose life abounds with curious features, married
Mademoiselle d'Aubign&egrave;, afterwards the celebrated Madame de
Maintenon, who was at that time only sixteen years of age. On his
marriage, the notary asked him what dowry he would settle upon his
wife? he replied, "Immortality: the names of the wives of kings die
with them, but the name of Scarron's wife shall live for ever." He
was accustomed to talk to his superiors with great freedom, and in
a very jocular style. In a dedication to the king, he thus
addressed his majesty: "I shall endeavour to persuade your majesty,
that you would do yourself no injury, were you to do me a small
favour; for in that case I should become gay. If I should become
more gay, I should write sprightly comedies; and if I should write
sprightly comedies, your majesty would be amused, and thus your
money would not be lost. All this appears so evident that I should
certainly be convinced of it, if I were as great a king as I am now
a poor unfortunate man." Scarron took pleasure in reading his works
to his friends, as he composed them; he used to call it trying
them. Segrais and another person coming to him one day, "Take a
chair," he said, "and sit down, that I may examine my Comic
Romance." When he saw them laugh very heartily, he said he was
satisfied, "my book will be well received since it makes persons of
such delicate taste laugh." He was not disappointed in his
expectations, for the Romance had a great run. In the year 1638, he
was attending the Carnival at Mons, of which he was a canon. Having
put on the dress of a savage, he was followed by a troop of boys
into a morass, where he was kept so long, that the cold penetrated
his debilitated limbs, which became contracted in such a manner,
that he used to compare his body to the shape of a Z. He died in
1660, at the age of fifty; he said to his friends who surrounded
his dying bed, "I shall never make you weep so much as I have made
you laugh." In his epitaph, made by himself, he desires, in a
mixture of the comic and the pathetic, that the passengers would
not awaken, by their noise, poor Scarron from the first good sleep
he had ever enjoyed.</p>

<h2>THE SELECTOR; AND LITERARY NOTICES OF <i>NEW WORKS.</i></h2>
<h3>LEGENDS OF THE LAKES; OR, SAYINGS AND DOINGS AT KILLARNEY.</h3>
<h4><i>By T. Crofton Croker, Esq.</i></h4>
<p>Two volumes of "tickling" legendary tales are almost too much
for our laughter-holding sides, but more especially at this merry
season&mdash;fraught with humour&mdash;and when reminiscences of
the past make up for lack of realities of the present. To "notice"
such a work is ten times more (we had almost said) trouble than to
despatch half a dozen dull books, or a dozen harmless, well-meaning
satires on human nature. But we will do our best to detach some of
the good things from Mr. Croker's volumes, although the humour of
the <i>sketches</i> which adorn them, is of too subtle a quality
for our pen or sheet to hold.</p>
<p>Mr. Croker takes for granted that when people go to see the
Lakes of Killarney, they do not intend making a very serious
business of the excursion; but rather desire, while their eyes are
pleased with romantic scenery, that their ears should be tickled by
legendary tales; and accordingly he thinks it extraordinary that no
guide-book should exist for the local traditions of Killarney. This
accounts for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page41" name=
"page41"></a>[pg 41]</span> our finding Mr. Croker on the box of
the Killarney mail coach, beside Mat. Crowley, the driver, at page
2, of his first volume. Here is no preamble about "friends pressing
the author to print&mdash;not intended for the public eye&mdash;a
mere note-book," &amp;c.&mdash;but he begins his journey with the
first crack of the whip, and a "righte merrie" journey it is.</p>
<p>Our facetious friend soon reaches Killarney, and is introduced
to the lord high-admiral of the lakes, and then, as the newspapers
say of a pantomime, the "fun begins." Our first extract is</p>
<p>O'SULLIVAN'S PUNCH BOWL.</p>
<p>"What are we to land here for?" said I to the coxswain.</p>
<p>"Only just to show your honour O'Sullivan's cascade," was the
reply. "Here, Doolan, show the gentleman the way." Ascending a
rugged path through the wood, we soon reached the foot of the
fall.</p>
<p>"Isn't that as fine a sight as you'd meet with in a month of
Sundays," said Doolan. "Only see how the white water comes
<i>biling</i> like a pot of <i>praties</i> over the big, black
rocks, down it comes, one tumble over the other, the green trees
all the while stretching out their arms as if they wanted to stop
it. And then it makes such a <i>dickins</i> of a <i>nise</i> as it
pounces into that black pool at the bottom, that it's enough to
bother the brains of a man entirely. Why, then, isn't it a wonder
how all that water sprung up out of the mountain? for sure, isn't
there a bit of a lake above there, in the hollow of the hill that
the waterfall comes out of,&mdash;they calls it O'Sullivan's Punch
Bowl?"</p>
<p>"And, pray, who was this O'Sullivan that had such a capacious
Punch Bowl?"</p>
<p>"Och, then, 'tis he's the fine, portly looking <i>jantleman</i>,
and has a <i>vice</i> (voice) as big as twenty; 'twould do your
heart good to hear the cry of him on a stag hunt day, making the
mountain ring again."</p>
<p>"Well, Doolan, you haven't told me all this time who O'Sullivan
is."</p>
<p>"Why, then, that's the <i>quare</i> question for your honour to
be after <i>axing</i> me. Sure all the country knows O'Sullivan of
Toomies, for didn't him, and his father before him, live at the
butt end of the mountain, near the neck of the Lawn; and wasn't
they great chieftains in the <i>ould</i> times; and hadn't they a
great sketch of country to themselves: they haven't so much now,
for their hearts were too big for their <i>manes</i> (means;) and
that's the <i>rason</i> O'Sullivan was obligated to sell this part
of the mountain to Mr. Herbert of Mucruss?"</p>
<p>"A sad story this, Doolan; but it seems to me these O'Sullivans
must have been very fond of a bowl of punch, or why is the lake you
mentioned called O'Sullivan's Punch Bowl?"</p>
<p>"Oh, then, your honour's as sharp as a needle entirely; but
about that same lake it's a <i>quare</i> story sure enough. A long
time before there was a waterfall here at all, one of the <i>rale
ould</i> O'Sullivans was out all day hunting the red deer among the
mountains. Well, sir, just as he was getting quite weary, and was
wishing for a drop of the <i>cratur</i> to put him in
spirits&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Or spirits into him," said I.</p>
<p>"Oh, sure, 'tis all the same thing," returned Doolan with a
grin, intended for a smile. "'Tis all one surely, if a man can only
have the drop when he wants it. Well, what should O'Sullivan see
but the most beautiful stag that ever was seen before or since in
this world; for he was as big as a colt, and had horns upon him
like a weaver's beam, and a collar of real gold round his neck.
Away went the stag, and away went the dogs after him full cry, and
O'Sullivan after the dogs, for he was determined to have that
beautiful fine stag; and though, as I said, he was tired and weary
enough, you'd think the sight of that stag put fresh life into him.
A pretty bit of a dance he led him, for he was an enchanted stag.
Away he went entirely off by Macgillicuddy's Reeks, round by the
mountains of the Upper Lake, crossed the river by the Eagle's Nest,
and never stopped nor staid till he came to where the Punch Bowl is
now. When O'Sullivan came to the same place he was fairly ready to
drop, and for certain that was no wonder; but what vexed him more
than all was to find his dogs at fault, and the never a bit of a
stag to be seen high nor low. Well, my dear <i>sowl</i>, he didn't
know what to make of it, and seeing there was no use in staying
there, and it so late, he whistled his dogs to him, and was just
going to go home. The moon was just setting over to the top of the
mountain shedding her light, broad and bright, over the edge of the
wood and down on the lake, which was like a sheet of silver, except
where the islands threw their black shadows over the water.
O'Sullivan looked about him, and began to grow quite dismal in
himself, for sure it was a lonesome sight, and besides he had a
sort of dread upon him, though he couldn't tell the reason why. So
not liking to stay there, as I said before, he was just going to
make the best of his way home, when, who should he see, but Fuan
Mac Cool (Fingal.) standing like a big <i>joint</i> (giant) on the
top of a rock. 'Hallo, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page42" name=
"page42"></a>[pg 42]</span> O'Sullivan,' says he, 'where are you
going so fast?' says he, 'come back with me,' says he, 'I want to
have some talk with you.' You may be sure it was O'Sullivan was
amazed and a little bit frightened too, though he wouldn't
<i>pertind</i> to it; and it would be no wonder if he was; for if
O'Sullivan had a big <i>vice</i>, (voice) Fuan Mac Cool had a
bigger ten times, and it made the mountains shake again like
thunder, and all the eagles fly up to the moon. 'What do you want
with me?' says O'Sullivan, at the same time putting on as
<i>bould</i> a face as he could. 'I want to know what business you
had hunting my stag?' says Fuan, 'by the vestment,' says he, 'if
'twas any one else but yourself, O'Sullivan, I'd play the red
vengeance with him. But, as you're one of the right sort, I'll pass
it over this time; and, as my stag has led you a pretty dance over
the mountains, I'll give you a drop of good drink, O'Sullivan; only
take my advice, and never hunt my stag again.' Then Fuan Mac Cool
stamped with his foot, and all of a sudden, just in the hollow
which his foot made in the mountain, there came up a little lake,
which tumbled down the rocks, and made the waterfall. When
O'Sullivan went to take a drink of it, what should it be but
<i>rale</i> whiskey punch, and it staid the same way, running with
whiskey punch, morning, noon, and night, until the
<i>Sasenaghs</i><a id="footnotetag4" name=
"footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> came into
the country, when all at once it was turned to water, though it
goes still by the name of O'Sullivan's Punch Bowl.'"</p>
<hr />
<p>In the island, the guide importunes Mr. Croker to visit the
shelf of a rock overshadowed by yew, and called the Bed of Honour,
"because 'twas there a lord-lieutenant of Ireland would go to sleep
to cool himself after drinking plenty of whiskey punch." He is
cautioned against venturing too near the ledge of a rock, "the very
spot the poor author gentleman fell from; they called him
Hell&mdash;Hell&mdash;no, 'twasn't Hell, either, but Hal; oh, then,
what a head I have upon me&mdash;oh, I have it now&mdash;Hallam's
the name, your honour."</p>
<p>"What the author of the Middle Ages?"</p>
<p>"True for you, sir, he was a middle aged man;" "and then there
was another great writing gentleman, one Sir Walter Scott,"
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Mr. Croker chances to be confined to his hotel by the rainy
weather, and this circumstance introduces the following legend,
narrated by one of his old friends:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, well," said Lynch, smiling, "I'll give you the legend of
Saint Swithin exactly as it was told to me about a month
since&mdash;I have occasionally employed an industrious, poor man,
named Tom Doody, to work in my garden. 'Well, Tom,' said I to him,
'this is Swithin's day, and not a drop of rain&mdash;you see the
old saying of "forty days' rain" goes for nothing.'&mdash;'O, but
the day isn't over yet,' said Tom, 'so you'd better not halloo,
sir, till you're out of the wood. I'll go bail we'll have rain some
time of the day, and then you may be sure of it for the forty
days.'&mdash;'If that's the way, Tom,' said I, 'this same Swithin
must have been the thirstiest saint in the calendar; and it's quite
certain he must be a real Irish saint, since he's so fond of the
drop.'&mdash;'You may laugh if you please,' said Tom, resting on
his spade, 'you may laugh if you please, but it's a bad thing any
how to <i>spake</i> that way of the saints; and, sure, Saint
Swithin was a blessed priest, and the rain was a miracle sent on
his account; but may be you never heard how it came to
pass.'&mdash;'No, Tom, I did not,' said I&mdash;'Well, then, I'll
tell you,' said he, 'how it was. Saint Swithin was a priest, and a
very holy man, so holy that he went by no other name but that of
the blessed priest. He wasn't like the priests now-a-days, who ride
about on fine horses, with spectacles stuck upon their noses, and
horsewhips in their hands, and polished boots on their legs, that
fit them as <i>nate</i> as a Limerick glove (God forgive me for
<i>spaking</i> ill of the <i>clargy</i>, but some of them have no
more conscience than a pig in a <i>pratie</i> garden;') I give you
Doody's own words," said Mr. Lynch.</p>
<p>"That's exactly what I wish."</p>
<p>"And he continued&mdash;'Saint Swithin was not that kind of
priest, no such thing; for he did nothing but pray from morning to
night, so that he brought a blessing on the whole country round;
and could cure all sorts of diseases, and was so charitable that
he'd give away the shirt off his back. Then, whenever he went out,
it was quite plain and sober, on a rough little <i>mountainy
garran</i>; and he thought himself grand entirely if his big
<i>ould</i> fashioned boots got a rub of the <i>grase</i>. It was
no wonder he should be called the blessed priest, and that the
people far and near should flock to him to mass and confession; or
that they thought it a blessed thing to have him lay his hands on
their heads. It's a pity the likes of him should ever die, but
there's no help for death; and sure if he wasn't so good entirely
he'd have been left, and not be taken away as he was; for 'tis them
that are most wanting <span class="pagenum"><a id="page43" name=
"page43"></a>[pg 43]</span> the first to go. The news of his death
flew about like lightning; and there was nothing but
<i>ullagoning</i> through all the country, and they had no less
than right, for they lost a good friend the day he died. However,
from <i>ullagoning</i>, they soon came to fighting about where he
was to be buried. His own parish wouldn't part with him if they got
half Ireland, and sure they had the best right to him; but the next
parish wanted to get him by the <i>lauve laider</i> (strong hand,)
for they thought it would bring a blessing on them to have his
bones among them; so his own parishioners at last took and buried
him by night, without the others knowing any thing about it. When
the others heard it they were tearing mad, and raised a large
faction, thinking to take him up and carry him away in spite of his
parishioners; so they had a great battle upon it; but those who had
the best right to him were beat out and out, and the others were
just going to take him up, when there came all at once such rain as
was never seen before or since; it was so heavy that they were
obliged to run away half <i>drownded</i>, and give it up as a bad
job. They thought, however, that it wouldn't last long, and that
they could come again; but they were out in that, for it never
stopped raining in that manner for forty days, so they were obliged
to give it up entirely; and ever since that time there's always
more or less rain on Saint Swithin's day, and for forty days
after.'</p>
<p>"Just as Tom Doody had finished his story there came a
tremendous shower. 'There now, why,' said Tom, with a look of
triumph, as we ran for shelter, 'there now, why, isn't it a true
bill? well, I knew Saint Swithin wouldn't fail us.' And I, as the
very elements seemed to be in his favour, was obliged to leave him
the victory."</p>
<hr />
<p>We pass over Mr. Croker's account of Mucruss Abbey and all its
legendary lore, to "Tim Marcks's adventures with a walking skull,"
at Aghadoe.</p>
<p>"A fine extensive prospect this," said I to General Picket, so
was my guide called.</p>
<p>"That's the good truth for your honour," he replied, "only it's
a mighty lonesome place, and they say it's haunted by spirits,
though Tim Marcks says there's no such thing. May be your honour
wouldn't know <i>Thicus Morckus</i>; he's a long <i>stocah</i> of a
fellow, with a big nose, wears knee breeches, corderoy leggings,
and takes a power of snuff. And, if your honour would like to see
him, he lives at Corrigmalvin, at the top of High Street, in the
town of Killarney. To be sure, some people say, all that comes from
Tim isn't gospel, but that's neither here nor there; so, as I was
saying, 'I don't believe in spirits,' says he to me, of a day he
was mending the road here, and I along with him&mdash;'The dickins
you don't,' says I, 'and what's your <i>rason</i> for that
same?'&mdash;'I'll tell you that,' says he; 'it was a <i>could</i>
frosty night in the month of December, the doors were shut, and we
were all sitting by the side of a blazing turf fire. My father was
smoking his <i>doodeen</i> in the chimney corner, my mother was
overseeing the girls that were tonging the flax, and I and the
other <i>gossoons</i> were doing nothing at all, only roasting
<i>praties</i> in the ashes. "Was the colt brought in?" says my
father. "Wisha, fakes then! I believes not," says I. "Why, then,
Tim," says he, "you must run and drive him in directly, for it's a
mortal could night." "And where is he, father?" says I. "In the far
field, at the other side of the <i>ould</i> church," says he.
"Murder!" says I, for I didn't like the thoughts of going near the
<i>ould</i> church at all, at all. But there was no use in saying
<i>agen</i> it, for my father (God be merciful to him!) had us
under as much command as a regiment of soldiers. So away I went,
with a light foot and a heavy heart. Well, I soon came to the
bounds' ditch between the farm and the <i>berrin</i> ground of the
<i>ould</i> church. Then I slackened my pace a little, and kept
looking hither and over, for fear of being taken by surprise. The
moon was shining clear as day, so that I could see the gray
tombstones and the white skulls; when, all at once, I thought one
of them began to move. I could hardly believe my two eyes; but,
fakes, it was true enough; for presently it came walking down the
hill, quite leisurely at first, then a little faster, till at last
it came rolling at the rate of a fox hunt. "Twill be stopped at the
bounds' ditch," thinks I; but I was never more out in my reckoning,
for it bowled fair through the gap, and made directly up to me. "By
the mortal frost," says I, "I'm done for;" and away I scampered as
fast as my legs could carry me; but the skull came faster after me,
for I could hear every lump it gave against the stones. It's a long
stretch of a hill from the <i>berrin</i> ground down to the road;
but you'd think I wasn't longer getting down than whilst you'd be
saying "Jack Robinson." Sure enough I did make great haste; but if
I did, "the more haste the worse speed," they say, and so by me any
how, for I went souse up to my neck in a dirty <i>Lochaune</i> by
the side of the road. Well, when I recovered a little, what
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page44" name="page44"></a>[pg
44]</span> would I see but the skull at the edge of the
<i>Lochaune</i>, stuck fast in a furze bush, and grinning down at
me. "Oh, you're there," says I; "I'll have one rap at you any how,
for worse than die I can't;" so I up with a lump of a blackthorn, I
had in my fist, and gives it a rap, when what should it be after
all, but a huge rat, which had got into the skull, and, trying to
get out again, it made it to roll down the hill in that frightful
way. To be sure,' said Tim, 'to be sure it was mighty frightful,
but it wasn't a ghost after all; and, indeed, (barring that) I
never saw any thing worse than myself, though we lived for a long
time near the <i>ould</i> church of Aghadoe.'"</p>

<h2>SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY.</h2>
<h3><i>Analogous Growth of Trees and Animals.</i></h3>
<p>Trees placed in an exposed situation have their
resources;&mdash;the object being to protect the sap-vessels, which
transmit nutriment, and which lie betwixt the wood and the bark,
the tree never fails to throw out, and especially on the side most
exposed to the blast, a thick coating of bark, designed to protect,
and which effectually does protect, the sap-vessels and the process
of circulation to which they are adapted, from the injury which
necessarily must otherwise ensue. Now, if an animal is in danger of
suffocation from want of vital air, instead of starving by being
exposed to its unqualified rigour, instinct or reason directs the
sufferer to approach those apertures through which any supply of
that necessary of human life can be attained, and induces man, at
the same time, to free himself from any coverings which may be
rendered oppressive by the state in which he finds himself. Now it
may be easily proved, that a similar instinct to that which induced
the unfortunate sufferers in the black-hole of Calcutta to struggle
with the last efforts to approach the solitary aperture which
admitted air to their dungeon, and to throw from them their
garments, in order to encourage the exertions which nature made to
relieve herself by perspiration, is proper, also, to the noblest of
the vegetable tribe. Look at a wood or plantation which has not
been duly thinned:&mdash;the trees which exist will be seen drawn
up to poles, with narrow and scanty tops, endeavouring to make
their way towards such openings to the sky as might permit the
access of light and air. If entirely precluded by the boughs which
have closed over them, the weaker plants will be found strangely
distorted by attempts to get out at a side of the plantation; and
finally, if overpowered in these attempts by the obstacles opposed
to them, they inevitably perish. As men throw aside their garments,
influenced by a close situation, trees placed in similar
circumstances, exhibit a bark thin and beautifully green and
succulent, entirely divested of that thick, coarse, protecting
substance which covers the sap-vessels in an exposed position.</p>
<p>There is a singular and beautiful process of action and
re-action which takes place betwixt the progress of the roots and
of the branches. The latter must, by their vigour and numbers,
stretch out under ground before the branches can develope
themselves in the air; and, on the other hand, it is necessary that
the branches so develope themselves, to give employment to the
roots in collecting food. There is a system of close commerce
between them; if either fail in discharging their part, the other
must suffer in proportion. The increase of the branches, therefore,
in exposed trees is and must be in proportion with that of the
roots, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>; and as the exposed tree spreads
its branches on every side to balance itself against the wind, as
it shortens its stem or trunk, to afford the mechanical force of
the tempest a shorter lever to act upon, so numerous and strong
roots spread themselves under ground, by way of anchorage, to an
extent and in a manner unknown to sheltered
trees.&mdash;<i>Quarterly Review</i>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><i>Preservation of Eggs.</i></h3>
<p>Relative to the preservation of eggs by immersion in lime-water,
M. Peschier has given most satisfactory evidence of the efficacy of
the process. Eggs which he had preserved for six years in this way,
being boiled and tried, were found perfectly fresh and good; and a
confectioner of Geneva has used a whole cask of eggs preserved by
the same means. In the small way eggs may be thus preserved in
bottles or other vessels. They are to be introduced when quite
fresh, the bottle then filled with lime-water, a little powdered
lime sprinkled in at last, and then the bottle closed. To prepare
the lime-water, twenty or thirty pints of water are to be mixed up
with five or six pounds of slaked <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page45" name="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span> quick-lime put into a
covered vessel allowed to clear by standing, and the lime-water
immediately used.</p>

<h2>WINE DRINKING.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Use a little wine, for thy stomach's sake.</p>
<p>I Tim. v. 23.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So says St. Paul&mdash;and this seems to have been the opinion
of the most ancient philosophers and physicians. A moderate use of
it has been sanctioned by the wise and good in all ages. Those who
have denied its virtues are those who have not been able to drink
it. Asclepiades wrote upon wine, the use of which he introduced
with almost every remedy, observing, that the gods had bestowed no
more valuable gift on man: even the surly Diogenes drank it; for it
is said of him, that he liked that wine best, which he drank at
other people's cost&mdash;a notion adopted by the oinopholous
Mosely, who, when asked, "What wine do you drink, doctor?"
answered, "Port at home&mdash;claret abroad!"</p>
<p>Hippocrates, the father of physic, recommends a cheerful glass;
and Rhases, an ancient Arabian physician, says, no liquor is equal
to good wine. Reineck wrote a dissertation "De Potu Vinoso;" and
the learned Dr. Shaw lauded the "juice of the grape." But the
stoutest of its medical advocates was Tobias <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page46" name="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span> Whitaker,
physician to Charles II., who undertook to prove the possibility of
maintaining life, from infancy to old age, without sickness, by the
use of wine!</p>
<p>It must, however, be remembered, that Whitaker was cordially
attached to wine, and a greater friend to the vintner than to the
apothecary, having as utter a dislike to unpalatable medicines, as
the most squeamish of his patients; therefore, Dr. Toby's evidence
must be taken with caution, independently of the courtly spirit
that might have led him to adapt his theories to the times.</p>
<p>It has been questioned whether the use of wine was known to the
antediluvian world; but there can be do doubt, in the corrupt state
of man, that wine would have its share in his debasement, and it
may be very strongly inferred, from the circumstance that Noah
planted a vineyard, and, moreover, "that he drank of the wine, and
was drunken," (Gen, ix. 20.)&mdash;a sad stain in the character of
a man who was "perfect in his generation;" and which also proves
that, in the earliest period of the world, the very best of men
were liable to fall into error and excess.</p>
<p>But the antiquity and propriety of wine-drinking is not matter
of question. The archbishop of Seville, Antonio de Solis, who lived
to be 110 years old, drank wine; and even that wonderful pattern of
propriety, Cornaro, did the same: but the question is about
quantity. Sir William Temple was pleased to lay down a rule, and
limit propriety to three glasses. "I drink one glass," says he,
"for health, a second for refreshment, a third for a friend; but he
that offers a fourth is an enemy."</p>
<p>As in eating, so in drinking, in the question of
quantity&mdash;much depends on the capacity of the stomach. A very
abstemious friend of mine, not long since, dined tete-a-tete with a
gentleman well known for his kindness and hospitality, and not less
so for his powers of bibulation. After dinner, at which a fair
share of many excellent wines was taken, Port and Madeira were put
on the table, and before the host, a <i>magnum</i> of Claret. My
friend drank his usual quantum, three glasses of Madeira, during
which time a great portion of the magnum had disappeared; and soon
afterwards, being emptied, the host said, "I think we can just
manage a bottle between us." The bottle was brought, and very
shortly disappeared, without the aid of the visiter.</p>
<p>The same gentleman and Lord &mdash;&mdash;, at the Angel at
Bury, fell in with some excellent Claret. They had disposed of six
bottles, when the landlord, who did not guess or <i>gauge</i> the
<i>quality</i> of his customers (the bell being rung for a fresh
supply,) begged very gently to hint that it was expensive stuff,
being fifteen shillings a bottle! "Oh! is it so? then bring up two
bottles directly!"</p>
<p>We have nothing, however, in modern times, at all equal to the
account given of some of the ancients. The elder Cato, we are told,
warmed good principles with a considerable quantity of good
wine.<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href=
"#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> But Cicero's son exceeds all others;
so much so, that he got the name of <i>Bicongius</i>, because he
was accustomed to drink two congii<a id="footnotetag6" name=
"footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> at a
sitting. Pliny, and others, abound in grand examples, that prove we
have degenerated at any rate in this respect, for these convivials
were neither sick nor sorry. Even that eminent debauchee, Nero, was
only three times sick in fourteen years. "Nam qui luxuriae
immoderatissimae esset, ter omnino per xiv. annos languit; atque
ita, ut neque <i>vino</i>, neque consuetudine <i>reliqua</i>
abstineret."</p>
<p>The Abb&eacute; de Voisenon, a very diminutive man, said to his
physician, who ordered him a quart of ptisan per hour, "Ah! my
friend, how can you desire me to swallow a quart an hour? I hold
only a pint."</p>
<p>Wine has not only been considered good for the body, but has,
from the earliest period, been thought invigorating to the mind.
Thus we find it a constant theme of praise with poets. Martial
says&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Regnat nocte calix, volvuntur biblia mane,</p>
<p class="i2">Cum Phoebo Bacchus dividit imperium.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>All night I drink, and study hard all day;</p>
<p class="i2">Bacchus and Phoebus hold divided sway.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Horace has done ample justice to it; and even Homer
says&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The weary find new strength in generous wine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Upon the principle, no doubt, of expanding the imagination, we
find, so early as 1374, old Geoffrey Chaucer had a pitcher of wine
a day allowed him. Ben Jonson, in after times, had the third of a
pipe annually; and a certain share of this invigorating aliment has
been the portion of Laureates down to the present day.</p>
<p>Nor are the poets the only eulogists of wine. Some of the
greatest names in history are to be found in the list. We find Mr.
Burke furnishing reasons why the rich and the great should have
their share of wine. He says, they are among <i>the
unhappy</i>&mdash;they feel personal pain and domestic
sorrow&mdash;they pay their full contingent <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page47" name="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span> to the
contributions levied on mortality in these matters;&mdash;therefore
they require this sovereign balm. "Some charitable dole," says he,
"is wanting to those, our often <i>very unhappy brethren</i>, to
fill the gloomy void that reigns in minds which have nothing on
earth to hope or fear; something to relieve the killing languor and
over-laboured lassitude of those who have nothing to do."</p>
<p>This observation of Mr. Burke's introduces it to our notice as a
remedy&mdash;as a medicine, in the hands of a physician. Thus we
find particular wines recommended by particular doctors, having a
fashionable run as specifics:&mdash;at one time all the gouty
people were drinking Madeira; and many a man persuaded himself he
had a fit of <i>flying</i> gout, for the sake of the remedy.<a id=
"footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href=
"#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> Somebody, however, found out that
Madeira contained acid, and straight the cellars were rummaged for
old Sherry. This change was attributed to Dr. Baillie, who had no
more to do with it than Boerhaave, as he has been known to declare.
Sherry, and nothing but Sherry, however, could or would the
<i>Podagres</i> drink.</p>
<p>Dr. Reynolds, who lived and practised very much with the higher
orders, had a predilection for that noble and expensive comforter,
Hoc! which short word, from his lips, has often made the doctor's
physic as costly as the doctor's fee.</p>
<p>Wine has also been recommended, by the highest medical
authorities, as alleviating the infirmities of old age.</p>
<p>A Greek physician recommended it to Alexander as the pure blood
of the earth.</p>
<p>Though an excess in wine is highly blamable, yet it is more
pardonable than most other excesses. The progressive steps to it
are cheerful, animating, and seducing; the melancholy are relieved,
the grave enlivened, the witty and gay inspired&mdash;which is the
very reverse of excess in eating: for, Nature satisfied, every
additional morsel carries dulness and stupidity with it. "Every
inordinate cup is unbless'd, and the ingredient is a devil," says
Shakspeare.</p>
<p>"King Edgar, like a king of good fellows," adds Selden, "or
master of the revels, made a law for Drinking. He gave orders that
studs, or knobs of silver or gold (so Malmesbury tells us.) should
be fastened to the sides of their cups, or drinking vessels, that
when every one knew his mark or boundary, he should, out of
modesty, not either himself covet, or force another to desire, more
than his stint." This is the only law, before the first parliament
under king James, that has been made against those swill-bowls,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Swabbers of drunken feasts, and lusty rowers,</p>
<p>In full-brimmed rummers that do ply their oars,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"who, by their carouses (tippling up Nestor's years as if they
were celebrating the goddess <i>Anna Perenna</i>,) do, at the same
time, drink others' health, and mischief and spoil their own and
the public."</p>
<p>An argument very much after this fashion was held by the learned
Sir Thomas More. Sir Thomas was sent ambassador to the Emperor by
king Henry the Eighth. The morning he was to have his audience,
<i>knowing the virtue of wine</i>, he ordered his servant to bring
him a good large glass of Sack; and, having drunk that, called for
another. The servant, with officious ignorance, would have
dissuaded him from it, but in vain; the ambassador drank off a
second, and demanded a third, which he likewise drank off;
insisting on a fourth, he was over-persuaded by his servant to let
it alone; so he went to his audience. But when he returned home, he
called for his servant, and threatened him with his cane. "You
rogue," said he, "what mischief have you done me! I spoke so to the
emperor, on the inspiration of those three glasses that I drank,
that he told me I was fit to govern three parts of the world. Now,
you dog! if I had drunk the fourth glass, I had been fit to govern
all the world."</p>
<p>The French, a very sober people, have a proverb&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Qu'il faut, &agrave; chaque mois,</p>
<p>S'enivrer au moins une fois.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Which has been improved by some, on this side the water, into an
excuse for getting drunk every day in the week, for fear that the
<i>specific day</i> should be missed. It would, however, startle
some of our sober readers, to find this made a question of grave
argument&mdash;yet, "whether it is not healthful to be drunk once a
month," is treated on by Dr. Carr in his letters to Dr.
Quincy.&mdash;<i>Brande's Jour.</i></p>
<hr />
<p>It is somewhat curious that two illustrious members of the Royal
Society should have distinguished themselves on <i>Angling</i>.
Nearly 200 years ago, Prince Rupert studied the art of tempering
<i>fish-hooks</i>; and the other day Sir Humphry Davy published a
volume on <i>Fly-fishing</i>.</p>

replying on the spot, "As it was not fatal, it could only have been
a <i>Gray's Inn</i> (grazing) wound."</p>
<hr />
<h3>TOASTS.</h3>
<p>After the battle of Assaye, at a <i>f&ecirc;te</i>, I recollect,
on one of these occasions, a rather illiterate character, who used
to say that "Father and he fit, caise he sold the beastesses for
too little money; so he coummed out a cadet," sat as
vice-president; the toast of "General Wellesley, and the heroes of
Assaye," was, as usual, given from the chair; when Mr. Vice, rising
majestically, and holding aloft his brimming glass, with a sonorous
voice, and north-country accent, echoed the toast in the words,
"General Wellesley, and here he is I say!"&mdash;<i>Twelve Years'
Military Adventures, &amp;c</i>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE MUG-HOUSE CLUB.</h3>
<h4>(<i>From "A Journey through England," 1722</i>.)</h4>
<p>In the City of London, almost every parish hath its separate
club, where the citizens, after the fatigue of the day is over in
their shops, and on the Exchange, unbend their thoughts before they
go to bed.</p>
<p>But the most diverting, or amusing of all, is the Mug-House-Club
in Long-Acre, where, every Wednesday and Saturday, a mixture of
gentlemen, lawyers, and tradesmen, meet in a great room, and are
seldom under a hundred.</p>
<p>They have a grave old gentleman in his own gray hairs, now
within a few months of ninety years old, who is their president;
and sits in an armed-chair, some steps higher than the rest of the
company, to keep the whole room in order. A harp plays all the time
at the lower end of the room; and every now and then one or other
of the company rises and entertains the rest with a song, and (by
the by) some are good masters. Here is nothing drank but ale, and
every gentleman hath his separate mug, which he chalks on the table
where he sits as it is brought in; and every one retires when he
pleases, as from a coffee-house.</p>
<p>The room is always so diverted with songs, and drinking from one
table to another to one another's healths, that there is no room
for politics, or any thing that can sour conversation.</p>
<p>One must be there by seven to get room, and after ten the
company are for the most part gone.</p>
<p>This is a winter's amusement, that is agreeable enough to a
stranger for once or twice, and he is well diverted with the
different humours, when the Mugs overflow.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
